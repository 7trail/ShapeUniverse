	<h2>By ???</h2>
    <ul id="left">
        <p><span style="color:yellow;">they came into focus during a sunset, right in a forest,</span></p>
<p><span style="color:yellow;">rhona looked at archon, then all around her,</span></p>
<p><span style="color:yellow;">the sky looked *just* a little different, the air a little cleaner, the grass a little longer,</span></p>
<p><span style="color:yellow;">it wasn't her world, yes, but she could get used to this,</span></p>

<p><span style="color:blue;">her mother, on the other hand-</span></p>
<p><span style="color:blue;">she sat, weeping for her wife,</span></p>
<p><span style="color:blue;">but soon enough, weeping turned to worrying,</span></p>
<p><span style="color:blue;">will there by anywhere for us to go, any place we can live our lives in peace?,</span></p>
<p><span style="color:blue;">will she even find us? or are we on our own?</span></p>
<p><span style="color:blue;">archon had once been saved, and now- now- now-</span></p>

<p><span style="color:green;">HAVING TAKEN THE SPELLBOOK FROM HER BAG, SHE SCREAMED THE WORDS INSCRIBED ON THE PAGE, PUSHING EVERY OUNCE OF HER MAGIC INTO THIS ONE MOMENT.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:green;">HER SCREAMS BOOMED IN THE SKY! TREES FLYING AWAY, STORMS COVERING THE PLANET, CRACKS IN THE VERY EARTH CASCADING ACROSS CONTINENTS, ALL IN AN INSTANT.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:green;">THE GROUND TREMBLED AS IT SHIFTED, CRUMBLING UNDER THE WORLD'S FEET, LIKE THE PREDATOR ENGULFING ITS PREY.</span></p>
<p><span style="color:green;">LIGHTNING STRUCK ONCE, THEN TWICE, THEN EVERYWHERE, UNTIL EVEN SHE DID NOT KNOW IF SHE WAS STILL STANDING.</span></p>

<p><span style="color:red;">and then it was over,</span></p>
<p><span style="color:red;">and she found herself in a very special place, a golden place-</span></p>
<p><span style="color:red;">there was her, and rhona, and someone that looks a lot like her,</span></p>
<p><span style="color:red;">and lastly, before her was a very familiar angel with four wings</span></p>
<p><span style="color:red;">"i can't have you doing that", she said, erasing the whole incident</span></p>
<p><span style="color:red;">"did you need something?"</span></p>
<p><span style="color:red;">so they explained everything</span></p>
<p><span style="color:red;">they told her of their life, and how they had to escape their own world, and who rhona was</span></p>
<p><span style="color:red;">the angel with four wings spoke again, understanding what had transpired</span></p>

<p>"you want *your* ------- back, it sounds like?"</p>
<p>archon was crying her eyes out, struggling to speak-</p>
<p>"that's all i want"</p>
<p>"there's something i can do", the angel said.</p>
<p>"it would be unwise to do it now, there is far too much danger at this time"</p>
<p>"i know it hurts to have to wait, but we *will* make this right, and your family will be made whole"</p>
<p>"please try and rest until then"</p>
<p>the special place began to dissolve around them...</p>

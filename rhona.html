i did not wish this to be our only communication, but time is running out for me. i hope you know your name by now- do not think for a second i was not watching. you do not know the tragedies i have endured, and part of that meant... meant leaving you, the way i did. i am proud of what you are, and wish i could see what you can become. this being said, there are some issues- i need a small favor. you will see a red ball. i need you to take it and hold it in your hands. feed energy into it, put your heart into it! you need not do anything more, but it is the only way to keep you safe. i apologize for the hastiness, and i hope when this is all over, we can sit down and rectify a decade of mistakes.

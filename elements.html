    <h1>Observation of Anomalous Elements</h1>
	<p>Let me begin these notes by acknowledging the steep difficulty- and inherent danger- in analyzing such objects. The power they have displayed to me is immense.</p>
	<p>While I wish I could deliver more to you, I only have the capabilites to transfer <b>one.</b> Choose wisely, and tell someone important which one you want to receive, and it will be done.</p>

			<h2>Otherworldly Conch</h2>
			<strong>Destination: MVCG-TVM</strong>
			<div class="scrollable-div">
				<i><blockquote>
					<p>"Can you hear that?"</p>
					<p>"What is it?"</p>
					<p>"It's... everything."</p>
				</blockquote></i>
				<p>The Otherworldly Conch pulsates with energy, energy that feels wrong to you. It doesn't feel like you should have it, and yet you do.</p>
				<p>If you hold the Otherworldly Conch to your ear, you will be overwhelmed with sounds of another world- all sorts of sounds, any sound you can imagine. It's all there, and you're hearing it all.</p>
				<p>Listening for too long isn't wise. If the Otherworldly Conch is listened to for more than ten minutes, the listener must succeed on a DC 10 Wisdom saving throw or be driven into madness for 1d10 hours. While under this effect, the afflicted individual cannot speak, write, or understand any languages, cast spells, and they automatically fail on any Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throws.</p>

			<h2>Midnight's Aspect</h2>
			<strong>Destination: NLWVIM</strong>
			<div class="scrollable-div">
				<i><blockquote>
					<p>"Wh- what are you?"</p>
					<p>"Why are you getting closer...?"</p>
					<p>"WHATAREYOUDOINGTOME?"</p>
				</blockquote></i>
				<p>Midnight's Aspect feels unusual to the person looking at it. It appears false, like you are peering into another world. The very area around it appears to warp and ripple, as if a hole is being torn in this reality.</p>
				<p>When you reach to take it, it leaps at you, infesting you with its very presence. Your figure is permanently altered, corrupted, by its unique characteristics. You may appear blurry and distorted, like you aren't fully <i>there</i>. <b>This cannot be removed under any circumstances. You are no longer whole.</b></p>
				<p>Once you reach Level 6, this aspect "turns on". Either through your own enhanced power or through sheer coincidence, you now feel more unstable than ever.</p>
				<p><u>Note- While most classes- and their respective buffs- were initially going to be predetermined, it's become apparent that the alterations should be more tailored to a given player. Please speak to the DM about what powers you receive.</u></p>

			<h2>Ring of the Last Wish</h2>
			<strong>Destination: KLHG-NLWVIM</strong>
			<div class="scrollable-div">
				<i><blockquote>
					<p>"Man, we could really use more money..."</p>
					<p>"Why don't we wish for it?"</p>
					<p>"What's a wish?"</p>
				</blockquote></i>
				<p>While wearing this ring, you can use an action to to cast the wish spell from it, ignoring all components. Wish, when casted this way, has these additional stipulations:
</p>
				<ol>
					<li>You cannot use this Wish to replicate any other spell- you must make a wish.</li>
					<li>You cannot directly Wish for more wishes, levels, or experience.</li>
					<li>The ripple effects caused by this Wish will be cataclysmic in nature.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>After you make your wish, the ring is consumed and disappears from the world.</p>

			<h2>Divine Legacy</h2>
			<strong>Destination: KIRNZO</strong>
			<div class="scrollable-div">
				<i><blockquote>
					<p>"Silence."</p>
					<p>"Silence is all anyone has known for centuries. The gods must have grown weary of their creation and left it to rot. We have no chance of redemption."</p>
					<p>"But what if I could press my thumb on the scale?"</p>
				</blockquote></i>
				<p>The Divine Legacy manifests itself as a golden orb, emitting a faint light continuously, and always hovering just above the hand of the wielder. The wielder doesn't fully understand why, but this item feels special. It feels holy. It feels like something no mortal has ever held before, and no mortal will ever hold again.</p>
				<p>As an action, once per month, the wielder may pray using the Divine Legacy to a god of their choice. They roll a d20. If the result is 10 or above, something relating to the god manifests itself around them, likely an atmospheric effect. If the result is 15 or above, they hear three words from the chosen god. If the result is 20, the god may provide a full sentence to the wielder.</p>
				<p>In addition to the above ability, the Divine Legacy may also be used as a spellcasting focus. For characters who otherwise could not cast spells through their chosen class, they learn 2 Cantrips of their choice, and may cast them while holding the Divine Legacy.</p>

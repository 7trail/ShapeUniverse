	<h2>By ???</h2>
    <ul id="left">
        <p><span style="color:yellow;">they came into focus during a sunset, right in a forest,
rhona looked at archon, then all around her,
the sky looked *just* a little different, the air a little cleaner, the grass a little longer,
it wasn't her world, yes, but she could get used to this,</span>
<br>
<span style="color:blue;">her mother, on the other hand-
she sat, weeping for her wife,
but soon enough, weeping turned to worrying,
will there by anywhere for us to go, any place we can live our lives in peace?,
will she even find us? or are we on our own?
archon had once been saved, and now- now- now-</span>
<br>
<span style="color:green;">HAVING TAKEN THE SPELLBOOK FROM HER BAG, SHE SCREAMED THE WORDS INSCRIBED ON THE PAGE, PUSHING EVERY OUNCE OF HER MAGIC INTO THIS ONE MOMENT.
HER SCREAMS BOOMED IN THE SKY! TREES FLYING AWAY, STORMS COVERING THE PLANET, CRACKS IN THE VERY EARTH CASCADING ACROSS CONTINENTS, ALL IN AN INSTANT.
THE GROUND TREMBLED AS IT SHIFTED, CRUMBLING UNDER THE WORLD'S FEET, LIKE THE PREDATOR ENGULFING ITS PREY.
LIGHTNING STRUCK ONCE, THEN TWICE, THEN EVERYWHERE, UNTIL EVEN SHE DID NOT KNOW IF SHE WAS STILL STANDING.</span>
<br>
<span style="color:red;">and then it was over,
and she found herself in a very special place, a golden place-
there was her, and rhona, and someone that looks a lot like her,
and lastly, before her was a very familiar angel with four wings
<br>
"i can't have you doing that", she said, erasing the whole incident
<br>
"did you need something?"
<br>
so they explained everything
they told her of their life, and how they had to escape their own world, and who rhona was
<br>
the angel with four wings spoke again, understanding what had transpired
<br></span>
"you want *your* ------- back, it sounds like?"
<br>
archon was crying her eyes out, struggling to speak
"that's all i want"
<br>
"there's something i can do", the angel said
"it would be unwise to do it now, there is far too much danger at this time"
"i know it hurts to have to wait, but we *will* make this right, and your family will be made whole"
"please try and rest until then"
<br>
the special place began to dissolve around them...</p>
<h1>...and they were okay.</h1>

    <h1>A Complete History of the Scholarly Council</h1>
    <ul id="left">
        <li>
            <strong>November 15, 1420 || </strong> ARPPRXZ and INPORI'C CGJTF begin an assault on UOHYR MJOIR. There are no mortal survivors, and the city was destroyed.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>November 17, 1420 || </strong> HJBRZ RZGRGOC is constructed over the course of 24 hours, serving as a replacement to UOHYR MJOIR.
        </li>
		<li>
            <strong>November 25, 1420 || </strong> ARPPRXZ selects five wizards from the town of CSTJHX, forming the first Scholarly Council.
        </li>
		<li>
			<strong>January 10, 1421 || </strong> The Scholarly Council organizes a public forum in HJBRZ RZGRGOC to address concerns and inquiries from the citizens about the recent assault and the city's reconstruction.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>April 8, 1421 || </strong> The Scholarly Council convenes to establish a magical barrier around HJBRZ RZGRGOC to protect it from potential threats.
		</li>
        <li>
            <strong>March 5, 1422 || </strong> ARPPRXZ is reunited with RTSLJH.
        </li>
		<li>
            <strong>October 20, 1423 || </strong> Matter is mysteriously removed from the universe.
        </li>
		<li>
            <strong>October 22, 1423 || </strong> The Scholarly Council becomes aware of (and successfully contains) anomalous elements outside of HJBRZ RZGRGOC.
        </li>
		<li>
            <strong>October 30, 1423 || </strong> The Scholarly Council discovers the origins of anomalous elements. In the process, information on the first-discovered alternative universe ("UNIVERSE X" in some documents) is uncovered.
        </li>
		<li>
            <strong>November 2, 1423 || </strong> Several unsuccessful attempts to return anomalous elements to UNIVERSE X occur. A human female named "POR" is discovered to have been the matter originally removed from the universe; this leads to the hypothesis that matter must be exchanged between two universes.
        </li>
		<li>
            <strong>December 31, 1451 || </strong> RXZPPR is born to ARPPRXZ and RTSLJH through manipulation of Energy Planes and Pre-Incarnate Souls.

		<li>
            <strong>September 12, 1468 || </strong> RXZPPR, sanctioned by the Scholarly Council, begins an expedition into deep space.
        </li>
		<li>
            <strong>September 18, 1468 || </strong> RXZPPR receives a vision of her own death. The psychological damage caused by this vision persists through the rest of her life.
			<br>Additional Information - The vision, when asked, contained three key elements:
			<br>&emsp;1. An individual with a large firearm was seen shouting at their companion.
			<br>&emsp;2. The individual was short and male. It's unclear if he was Dwarven in descent, but RXZPPR believes that to be the case.
			<br>&emsp;3. The indiviual pointed the gun at her and fired.
        </li>
		<li style="color:yellow;">
            <strong>February 3, 1471 || </strong> RXZPPR confronts an individual whom she suspects to be the person seen in her vision.

        </li>
		<li style="color:blue;">
            <strong>February 15, 1471 || </strong> RXZPPR confronts an individual whom she suspects to be the person seen in her vision.

		<li style="color:green;">

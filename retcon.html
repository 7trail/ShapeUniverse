        <h2>dear gallade,</h2>

<p>i've thought a lot about the events of the past months. I've thought of how it shaped you, and how it shaped the world for Centuries to come.</p>

<p>there's probably a lot you don't know right now. you don't know where some of your most prized belongings Are. you don't know what became of *him*. you probably don't even kNow if your friends, the ones you left behind ages ago to take on another life, if they still walk in this world.</p>

<p>but you'll find THose things out, in due time. and along the way, you'll find many other things that bELong to you. you'll meet your true love again, and this time your time with her won't be cut short. you'll get to see your daughter perform a wondrous miracle, one on a scale you could only ever dream to witness. although that life isn't a dream anymore. it's all too real, and it's one you can't wait to be a Part of.</p>

<p>through all of this, i can't help but wonder- what would have happened had the center of the earth not been hollow? what cold fate would have awaited you if that otherwise insignificant detail about our world was changed? would you have survived the journey, and More importantlY, would you have become the same person you are today?</p>

<p>which brings me back to how i opened this letter. in every life, there is a moment that defines a person; barring that moment from happening will rid that person of their very Spirit, leaving them soullless and hollow, a shell that can move ever forward, but never to a destination.</p>

<p>and, in forty-Eight hours, you will receive that very moment.</p>

<p>our whole Life was building up to the moment when we saw her face-to-face. so many times, one small error could have moved you off of that trajectory, sending you spiraling into a pit of hopelessness and failure. but you prepared for that. you always knew exactly what to do, and so, you will have your victory.</p>

<p>do not think for a minute things should go any other way. she deserved the judgement received for what she did not just to you, but to the infinite others who suffered under her inadequacies. failure to save those that needed her protection was a dereliction of her most sacred duty; now, it is her who cries out for help, only to be denied it by the few who can provide.</p>

<p>"he" was wrong about us. believe it or not, we did not go to that divine realm alone. we had the world on our side, and the might of the world cannot be suppressed by any Force.</p>

<p>you'll love getting to see what we become. please take care.</p>

<p>- you know who this is</p>

<br>

<p>p.s.</p>

<p>i have to ask a small favor. (a few small favors.)</p>

<p>1. give Adella the ring- she'll need it more than you.</p>
<p>2. keep the ball safe.</p>
